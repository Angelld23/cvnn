`My personal website <https://negu93.github.io/agustinbarrachina/>`_

I am a PhD student from `Ecole CentraleSupelec <https://www.centralesupelec.fr/>`_
with a scholarship from `ONERA <https://www.onera.fr/en>`_ and the `DGA <https://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga>`_

I am basically working with Complex-Valued Neural Networks for my PhD topic.
In the need of making my coding more dynamic I build a library not to have to repeat the same code over and over for little changes and accelerate therefore my coding.
