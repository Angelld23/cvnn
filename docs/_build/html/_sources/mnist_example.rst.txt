MNIST Example
-------------

This example is based on `Training a neural network on MNIST with Keras <https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/keras_example>`_ and is used to help prove the correct performance of our model (as it renders the same result).

First lets import whats needed::

    import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
    import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
    from cvnn.cvnn_model import CvnnModel
    from cvnn import layers
    import numpy as np

    tfds.disable_progress_bar()
    tf.enable_v2_behavior()
