Getting Started
===============

If you are here is because you want to train a Complex-Valued Neural Network (CVNN). 
However, your situation may vary, this will help you find your use case and guide you how to use the library.
The recommended way to go would be 1.2. as the other may easily be done from that.

    1. You already have a complex dataset you want to use
        :doc:`1.1. You want to train a Complex Valued Model as you will do with Keras <cvnn>`
        1.2. You want to compare different models and do statistics with it's results
            - You want to feed each model to compare :ref:`montecarlo_class`.
            - You want a RVNN equivalent to be created automatically and compare it with the feeded CVNN :ref:`real_vs_complex`.
         
    :doc:`2. You don't have a specific dataset, you just want to play with this library <experiments/correlation_noise>`
